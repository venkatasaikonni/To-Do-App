# To-Do-App
An application where we can add tasks in the form of notes and update them with a clean user interface using HTML, CSS and JS.
In this web development project, we have crafted a straightforward yet functional To-Do application using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, hosted on CodeSandbox for convenient accessibility. The project comprises three key files: index.html, styles.css, and app.js. Each file plays a crucial role in shaping the structure, styling, and functionality of the To-Do app.

The HTML file (index.html) establishes the basic structure of the web page, containing the essential elements such as the header, input field, task list, and script reference. Within the <head> section, a meta tag ensures proper rendering on various devices, and a link tag connects the HTML file to the external CSS file (styles.css) for styling purposes. Meanwhile, the <body> section initializes a container div with a unique identifier, 'root,' which serves as the mounting point for our React application.

The CSS file (styles.css) provides the visual aesthetics and layout for the To-Do app. It defines the overall styling, including font choices, background colors, container dimensions, list styles, and button appearances. The styling adheres to a clean and modern design, enhancing user experience and readability. By leveraging flexbox for list items and incorporating responsive design principles, the application maintains a visually pleasing layout across various screen sizes.

The JavaScript file (app.js) drives the functionality of the To-Do app. Developed with React, it utilizes functional components and hooks to manage state, such as the task list and the input for adding new tasks. Two useEffect hooks handle the loading and saving of tasks to local storage, ensuring persistent data even after page reloads. Additionally, functions like addTask, toggleTask, and deleteTask enable users to seamlessly interact with the application, adding, marking completion, and deleting tasks.

The To-Do app incorporates a checkbox to toggle task completion status, dynamic styling to indicate completed tasks, and delete buttons for task removal. Tasks are stored locally in the browser's localStorage, allowing users to maintain their task list across sessions.

By hosting the project on CodeSandbox, an online development environment, the application becomes instantly accessible via a web browser. This approach eliminates the need for local installations and facilitates easy sharing of the project with others. Users can view, interact with, and even modify the To-Do app in real-time through the provided CodeSandbox link.

In summary, this web development project serves as a comprehensive example for beginners, demonstrating how to structure files, connect them for seamless integration, and implement fundamental functionalities. The To-Do app, while simple, encompasses key concepts in web development, making it an excellent starting point for those looking to gain practical experience in building web applications.
